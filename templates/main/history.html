<h1 class="title">History and Hall of Fame</h1>
<p>
    The ANU Mountaineering Club has a proud history stretching back more
    than half a century. Founded by a handful of adventurous students
    keen to explore the hills around Canberra, the club quickly grew
    into one of the most active university outdoor clubs in Australia.
</p>
<p>
    Over the decades, members have pioneered first ascents, discovered
    hidden caves, skied remote backcountry routes and introduced
    hundreds of novices to the joy of the outdoors. The club has also
    produced world‑class climbers, mountaineers and expedition leaders
    who have gone on to climb in the Himalaya, Alps, Andes and Alaska.
</p>
<p>
    Highlights from our history include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first recorded ascent of Booroomba Rocks by club members in
    the 1960s.</li>
    <li>Regular expeditions to Tasmania’s remote Southwest wilderness.
    </li>
    <li>Introducing caving to the ACT region and mapping systems in
    Yarrangobilly and Wee Jasper.</li>
    <li>The development of an inclusive trip leader training program
    that has become the benchmark for university outdoor clubs.
    </li>
    <li>The annual publication of “Epic”, our magazine showcasing trip
    reports, essays and photography from members past and present.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Our Hall of Fame celebrates members who have made outstanding
    contributions to the club’s spirit and success. It recognises
    leaders, volunteers and athletes who embody our values of safety,
    inclusivity, respect for the environment and a passion for
    adventure. Nominees are announced at the AGM each year.
</p>
<p>
    If you have stories, photos or memorabilia from the club’s past,
    please get in touch—we’d love to feature them here and preserve
    them for future generations of ANUMC members.

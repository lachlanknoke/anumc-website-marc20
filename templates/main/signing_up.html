<h1 class="title">Signing Up</h1>
<p>
    Ready to join the ANU Mountaineering Club? Follow these steps to
    become a member and start signing up for trips:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Join ANU Sport:</strong> Visit the ANU Sport website and
        create a free account. Select “ANU Mountaineering Club” as one
        of your clubs and pay the membership fee (see FAQs for
        pricing). Keep a copy of your UniSport receipt.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Email your receipt:</strong> Send your receipt, your
        full name and the email you used to register to
        <a href="mailto:anumountaineeringclub@gmail.com">anumountaineeringclub@gmail.com</a>.
        Our executive volunteers will manually activate your ANUMC
        account. This process usually takes 1–2 business days.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Activate your ANUMC account:</strong> Once your
        account is created you will receive a confirmation email.
        Follow the link in the email to set your password and log in to
        the ANUMC website.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sign up for trips:</strong> After logging in, browse
        the Trip Calendar and click “Sign up” on trips you’re
        interested in. Make sure you meet any skill or fitness
        requirements listed.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Having trouble?</strong> Sometimes the automatic account
    creation fails (e.g. if ANU Sport’s website is down). If you
    haven’t received a confirmation email within a few days, or if you
    can’t log in after paying, please email us with your receipt and
    we will set up your account manually. During busy periods there may
    be a short delay; thanks for your patience!

<h1 class="title">Club Ethics</h1>
<p>
    The ANUMC is committed to creating a safe, inclusive and
    environmentally responsible outdoor community. We expect all
    members to uphold the following principles on every trip and at
    every event:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Respect for the environment:</strong> Practise Leave No
    Trace. Stay on established tracks where possible, pack out all
    rubbish, minimise campfire impacts and protect wildlife and
    vegetation.</li>
    <li><strong>Safety first:</strong> Follow the instructions of your
    trip leader, carry appropriate gear, know your limits and speak up
    if you feel unsafe. Leaders are trained to manage risk but safety
    is a shared responsibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Inclusivity:</strong> We welcome people of all
    backgrounds, identities and experience levels. Treat others with
    respect, support newcomers and contribute to a positive, friendly
    culture free from harassment and discrimination.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Arrive on time, come prepared
    and commit to the trips you sign up for. If you need to cancel,
    notify the leader as early as possible so someone on the waitlist
    can take your place.</li>
    <li><strong>Alcohol and drugs:</strong> Consumption of alcohol or
    drugs is not permitted during trips or in the field. Social
    events may involve alcohol in moderation; always drink responsibly
    and look out for your mates.</li>
    <li><strong>Develop your skills:</strong> Take opportunities to
    learn new skills and, when ready, give back by volunteering,
    leading trips or helping at the gear store.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Our club operates under the ANU Sport Member Protection Policy and
    the Universityâ€™s Student Code of Conduct. Breaches of these
    principles may result in disciplinary action. By joining the club
    you agree to abide by these ethics and help foster a supportive
    mountaineering community.
